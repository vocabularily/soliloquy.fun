      <description>Ever wonder why some find learning languages easy, while others find it hard to remember simple words? The key is usually not talent but regular practice. Learning a language is like building a bridge, one brick at a time. Each word you learn and each sentence you say makes your language bridge stronger.

I&amp;rsquo;ve experienced that too, more than I can count. Whether it was back in high school facing that final English exam, or even at work, trying to talk to clients.</description>
